**Perfect Pressure** is a precision cycling tool that determines the mathematically optimal tire pressure for a specific rider, bike, and surface combination. By measuring the relationship between Speed/Distance and Power Output across multiple test runs, the app calculates the exact point where rolling resistance is minimized before surface impedance (vibration) causes it to rise again.

## 🚴 Core Methodology

The application implements a **3-Run Minimum Protocol** using Quadratic Regression to identify the vertex of your pressure-efficiency curve — the sweet spot between too-hard (harsh, vibrating) and too-soft (high rolling resistance) tires.

### Testing Protocols

| Protocol | Action | Power Meter Required | Min Runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Coast-Down** | Coast a hill with no pedaling | No | 3 |
| **Constant Power** | Flat road at steady wattage | Yes | 3 |
| **Lap Efficiency** (Chung) | Closed loop — Avg Power vs Avg Speed | Yes | 3 |

## ✨ Features

- **Persistent Bluetooth Connectivity** — Connects and holds CSC (Speed/Cadence) and Power Meter sensors via standard GATT profiles. Automatically reconnects on drop.
- **GPS Speed Fallback** — When no Bluetooth speed sensor is paired, GPS-derived speed is used seamlessly as a substitute.
- **Continuous FIT File Recording** — All run data is streamed directly to a `.fit` file on disk (not buffered in RAM). Uses FIT Lap messages to tag each pressure interval.
- **Quadratic Regression Analysis** — After 3+ runs the app solves for the Coefficient of Rolling Resistance (CRR) vertex and displays the optimal pressure recommendation.
- **Interactive Pressure–Efficiency Chart** — Visual curve rendered with `fl_chart` showing all tested pressures and the calculated optimum.
- **Previous Tests History** — Browse and re-analyse past FIT files stored on device.
- **FIT File Inspector** — In-app viewer to inspect raw FIT message records from any session.
- **Silca Pressure Ratios** — Front pressure is automatically calculated from rear input using bike-type-specific Silca ratios (Road 95 %, MTB 85 %, Gravel/Hybrid 90 %).
- **Wakelock** — Keeps CPU and screen alive during active recording to prevent OS from killing Bluetooth or file I/O.
- **Standardised Dark UI** — Consistent dark theme (`#121418` background, `#47D1C1` accent) across all recording and analysis pages.

## 🔬 Algorithm Overview

1. **Data Collection** — Each run records `(pressure, avgSpeed, avgPower)` tuples, tagged by FIT Lap messages.
2. **CRR Derivation** — Rolling resistance coefficient is estimated from the speed–power relationship:  
   $C_{rr} = \frac{P - P_{aero}}{m \cdot g \cdot v}$
3. **Quadratic Regression** — Fit $f(p) = ax^2 + bx + c$ to the (pressure, CRR) dataset.
4. **Vertex** — Optimal pressure $p^* = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where rolling resistance is minimal.

## ⚠️ Safety & Testing Guidelines

- **Traffic** — Use routes with zero or minimal traffic.
- **Pressure Limits** — Never exceed your rim's or tire's rated max/min pressure.
- **Consistency** — Hold the same body position, line, and effort across all runs.
- **Mounting** — Secure the phone to the handlebars for valid accelerometer data.
- **Conditions** — Avoid comparing runs across significantly different wind, temperature, or road-surface conditions.
